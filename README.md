# DevOps Pipeline with Amazon EKS
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for containerized applications using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications to an EKS cluster. Key tools and technologies involved include:

* Jenkins: For continuous integration and deployment.
* Docker: For containerizing applications.
* Helm: For managing Kubernetes applications.
* Amazon EKS: As the Kubernetes cluster provider.
* AWS CodePipeline: To automate the CI/CD workflow.

The project covers the end-to-end process, including infrastructure setup, pipeline creation, and deployment automation, ensuring a scalable and reliable environment for modern application delivery.
